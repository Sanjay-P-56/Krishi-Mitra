# Kisan Mitra üå±

## Empowering Indian Farmers through Technology

Kisan Mitra aims to solve these problems through a unified platform that leverages technology to bridge the gap between farmers, buyers, agricultural experts, and service providers.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for building the user interface
- **React Router** for navigation
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive and customized styling
- **i18next** for internationalization (supporting multiple Indian languages)
- **Lucide React** for icons and visual elements

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express for the web server
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose for database operations
- **JWT** for secure authentication
- **bcrypt.js** for password encryption
- **Express Validator** for input validation

### Machine Learning Services
- **Python** with FastAPI for ML model serving
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation

## Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Crop Recommendation System
Our machine learning model analyzes soil parameters (N, P, K), climate conditions (temperature, humidity), and rainfall data to recommend the most suitable crops for a farmer's specific field conditions.

### 2. Fertilizer Recommendation Engine
Based on soil type, crop type, and environmental factors, the system recommends the optimal fertilizers to maximize yield while minimizing environmental impact.


### 7. Multi-lingual Support
The platform supports multiple Indian languages including:
- Hindi
- Tamil
- Telugu
- Kannada
- English

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Crop Recommendation System
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 99% on test data
- **Features**: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall
- **Output**: Top crop recommendations with confidence scores

### 2. Fertilizer Recommendation System
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 97% on test data
- **Features**: Temperature, Humidity, Moisture, Soil Type, Crop Type, NPK values
- **Output**: Optimal fertilizer recommendation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ and npm
- Python 3.11+
- MongoDB
